"""
Problem 3.2.2 - Write a program that translates a letter grade entered by the user into the 
corresponding numerical grade and prints it. The letter grades are 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'F', 
possibly followed by a + or – sign. Their numerical values are, in order, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0 and
0.0. 'F+' and 'F–' grades do not exist. A + sign increases the numerical grade by 0.3, while a –
sign decreases it by the same amount. The 'A+' grade is equal to 4.0. [P3.12]
