07.1.1 Sum with alternating signs. Write a program that receives as input a sequence of integers 
(terminated by an empty line), and that calculates the alternating sum of its elements. For example, if 
the program reads the data 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11, it must calculate and display 
1 - 4 + 9 - 16 + 9 - 7 + 4 - 9 + 11 = â€“2.
